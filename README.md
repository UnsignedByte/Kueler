#### Example:

The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear a signal. A single lap should be completed each time you hear a ding. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
